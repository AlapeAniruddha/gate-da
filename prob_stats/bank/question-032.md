The average diameter of pipes manufactured by a company is reported to be 25mm, which you suspect to be too low. You observed a random sample of diameters of 10 pipes (in mm) as $24.58, 24.67, 24.99, 25.22, 25.32, 25.25, 24.96, 24.87, 25.52, 24.85$. Based on this information, what conclusion can you reach about your suspicion at significance level of $5\%?$  

Use $F_{t_9}^{-1}(0.95) = 1.8331129$  

- [ ] Accept $H_0$
  
- [ ] Reject $H_0$

Null and alternative hypothesis will be:

$H_0 : \mu = 25$ and $H_1 : \mu > 25$
Here, we don't know the population variance $\sigma^2$. Therefore, we will use t-test.

Test will be : Reject $H_0$ if 
$\overline{X} > c$

Use $\alpha = P\left(\text{Reject}~~ H_0 ~|~ H_0 \right)$.

Find the value of $c$ by solving the above part and then make conclusion.
