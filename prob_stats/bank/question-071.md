Suppose $X$ is normally distributed with unknown standard deviation $\sigma$. Let $X_1, X_2,\ldots,$ $X_{16}$ be an i.i.d. sample with distribution $X$ and a sample standard deviation $s_X = 3.5$. What conclusion
 would a $\chi^2$-test reach if the null hypothesis assumes $\sigma = 3$, with an alternate hypothesis that $\sigma > 3$, and a significance level of $\alpha = 0.05$?




- [ ]  Reject the null hypothesis.

  
- [ ] Do not reject the null hypothesis.
