Let $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_5$ be independent and identically distributed normal random variables with mean 0 and variance 1. Define $Y = \sum_{i=2}^{5}X_i^2$. Which of the following statements is true about $Y?$

- [ ] $Y \sim \chi^2_4$ 

  
- [ ] $Y \sim \chi^2_5$ 

  
- [ ] $Y \sim N(5,4)$ 
  

- [ ] $Y \sim \chi^2_6$

Use the definition of Chi-square distribution as

If $Z_1, Z_2, \ldots, Z_k$ be independent and identically distributed normal random variables with mean 0 and variance 1, then the random variable

$Y = \sum_{i=1}^{k}Z_i^2$ follows a chi-square distribution with $k$ degrees of freedom.

- [x] $Y \sim \chi^2_4$ 

  
- [ ] $Y \sim \chi^2_5$ 

  
- [ ] $Y \sim N(5,4)$ 
  

- [ ] $Y \sim \chi^2_6$

Given,
Let $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_5$ be independent and identically distributed normal random variables with mean 0 and variance 1.
Then, $Y = \sum_{i=2}^{5}X_i^2 = X_2^2 + X_3^2 + X_4^2 + X_5^2$ will follow chi-square distribution with 4 degrees of freedom.

Hence, option (A) is correct.
