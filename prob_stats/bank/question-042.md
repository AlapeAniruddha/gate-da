If the sample variance of a data of size $10$ is $23$, then what is the population variance of this data$?$

- [ ] $25.56$
  
- [ ] $19$
  
- [ ] $20.7$

- [ ] $23$

Sample variance, $s^2 = \dfrac{\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n-1}$ and

Population variance, $\sigma^2 = \dfrac{\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n}$

Find the relation between $s^2$ and $\sigma^2$ by using the above formula and calculate the value of population variance.
