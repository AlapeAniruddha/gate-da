Consider the following situation and match them with suitable test statistics and hypothesis test:

Suppose we observe samples from a normal distribution, where the variance is unknown. We want to check whether the variance is greater than $\sigma^2$. What test statistic and test can be applied to this situation$?$

- [ ] Test Statistic: $T$ = Sample mean, Hypothesis test: $t$-test. 

  
- [ ] Test Statistic: $T$ = Sample mean, Hypothesis test: $\chi^2$-test.

  
- [ ] Test Statistic: $T$ = Sample variance, Hypothesis test: $\chi^2$-test.
  

- [ ] Test Statistic: $T$ = Sample variance, Hypothesis test: $F$-test.

Hupothesis will be :

$H_0 :$ Population variance will be equal to $\sigma^2$.

$H_1 :$ Population variance is greater than $\sigma^2$.

Based on this information, choose the correct option.
