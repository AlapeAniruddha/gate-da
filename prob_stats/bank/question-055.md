Two friends, Meenal and Sonika, play a game. Meenal rolls a fair six-sided die once, and Sonika flips a fair coin once. Let $X$ be the outcome of the die and $Y$ be the value of the coin flip (where $Y$ = 1 if heads and $Y$ = 0 if tails). If the prize of the game is $Z = XY$, then find the expected prize value.
