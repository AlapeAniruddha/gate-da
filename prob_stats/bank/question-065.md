Suppose a $95\%$ confidence interval for the mean weight of apples from a certain orchard is calculated to be$(150g, 170g)$. Which of the following statements are correct $?$ (Select all that apply)

- [ ]  If we were to test the null hypothesis $H_0 : \mu = 165$ grams at the $5\%$ level of significance, we would fail to reject $H_0$.

  
- [ ] The interval suggests that the population mean could be as low as $150g$ or as high as $170g$.

  
- [ ] If we were to test the null hypothesis $H_0 : \mu = 145$ grams at the $5\%$ level of significance, we would reject $H_0$. 
  

- [ ] None of the above.

- [x]  If we were to test the null hypothesis $H_0 : \mu = 165$ grams at the $5\%$ level of significance, we would fail to reject $H_0$.

  
- [x] The interval suggests that the population mean could be as low as $150g$ or as high as $170g$.

  
- [x] If we were to test the null hypothesis $H_0 : \mu = 145$ grams at the $5\%$ level of significance, we would reject $H_0$. 
  

- [ ] None of the above.

Option $A$ is correct : Since $165g$ is within the confidence interval, we fail to reject the null hypothesis that the population mean is $165g$ at a $5\%$ significance level.

Option $B$ is correct : The confidence interval suggests that the population mean could reasonably be any value between $150g$ and $170g$.

Option $C$ is correct : Since $145g$ is outside the confidence interval, we would reject the null hypothesis that the population mean is $145g$ at the $5\%$ significance level.
