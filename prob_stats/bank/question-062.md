A $99\%$ confidence interval for the mean of a population is calculated from a sample as $(45.2, 54.8)$. What will happen to the interval if the confidence level is decreased to $95\%,$ assuming the same sample statistics$?$

- [ ] The interval will become wider. 

  
- [ ] The interval will remain the same.

  
- [ ] The interval will become narrower.
  

- [ ] There is not enough information to determine the change.

When the confidence level decreases, the critical value also decreases, which reduces the margin of error and results in a narrower confidence interval.

Hence, option (C) is correct.
