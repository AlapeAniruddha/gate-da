Let $X$ and $Y$ be independent random variables with $E[X] = 3, E[Y] = 2, \text{Var}(X) = 1$ and $\text{Var(Y)} = 4$. Find the variance of the product $Z = XY$.

Use the concept of "Independence of two random variables", i.e., if $X$ and $Y$ are two independent random variables then $E[XY] = E[X]E[Y]$
