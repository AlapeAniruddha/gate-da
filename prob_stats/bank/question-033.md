The weight of new born babies in a town is reported to have a standard deviation of $0.25$ kg, which you suspect is too low. A sample of 10 newborn babies had weights(in kg) as $2.25, 2.5, 3, 2.75, 2.40, 2.20, 3.10, 2.50, 2.80, 2.75$. Based on this information, what conclusion can you reach about your suspicion at significance level of $5\%?$   

Use $F_{\chi^2_9}^{-1}(0.95) = 16.918977$  

- [ ] Accept $H_0$
  
- [ ] Reject $H_0$

Null and alternative hypothesis will be:

$H_0 : \sigma = 0.25$ and $H_1 : \sigma > 0.25$


Test will be : Reject $H_0$ if 
$S^2 > c^2$, where $S^2$ is the sample variance of the given dataset.

Use $\alpha = P\left(\text{Reject}~~ H_0 ~|~ H_0 \right)$.

Find the value of $c$ by solving the above part and then make conclusion.
