A teacher observes  that the cumulative distribution function (CDF) for the scores on a mathematics test is

$$F(x) = \begin{cases}
    0, & x<0\\
    x^2, &0\leq x \leq 1\\
    1, & x>1
\end{cases}$$ for $0 \leq x \leq 1,$ 

where $x$ is the score normalized to $1$. If a student scores above $0.7$, what is the conditional probability that they actually score above $0.9?$ Enter the answer correct up to two decimal places.
