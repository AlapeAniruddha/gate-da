Let $R(A,B,C,D)$  be a relational schema with the following functional dependencies :  
$A \rightarrow B$,  $B\rightarrow C$, $C \rightarrow D$ and $D \rightarrow B$.

The decomposition of $R$ into $(A,B), (B,C), (B,D)$

- [ ] gives a lossless join, and is dependency preserving  
- [ ] gives a lossless join, but is not dependency preserving  
- [ ] does not give a lossless join, but is dependency preserving  
- [ ] does not give a lossless join and is not dependency preserving
