Let 𝑅(𝐴,𝐵,𝐶,𝐷) be a relational schema with the following functional dependencies :  
𝐴→𝐵,  𝐵→𝐶,  𝐶→𝐷 and 𝐷→𝐵.

The decomposition of 𝑅 into (𝐴,𝐵),(𝐵,𝐶),(𝐵,𝐷)

- [ ] gives a lossless join, and is dependency preserving  
- [ ] gives a lossless join, but is not dependency preserving  
- [ ] does not give a lossless join, but is dependency preserving  
- [ ] does not give a lossless join and is not dependency preserving
