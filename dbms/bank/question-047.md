𝐴→𝐵,  𝐵→𝐶,  𝐶→𝐷 and 𝐷→𝐵.

The decomposition of 𝑅 into (𝐴,𝐵),(𝐵,𝐶),(𝐵,𝐷)

1. gives a lossless join, and is dependency preserving  
2. gives a lossless join, but is not dependency preserving  
3. does not give a lossless join, but is dependency preserving  
4. does not give a lossless join and is not dependency preserving
