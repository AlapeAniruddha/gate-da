In SQL, relations can contain null values, and comparisons with null values are treated as unknown. Suppose all comparisons with a null value are treated as false. Which of the following pairs is not equivalent?

- [ ] $x=5, \text{not}(\text{not}(x=5))$
- [ ] $x=5, x>4$ and $x<6$, where $x$ is an integer  
- [ ] $x\neq 5, \text{not}(x=5)$  
- [ ] none of the above

- [ ] $x=5, x>4$ and $x<6$, where $x$ is an integer
