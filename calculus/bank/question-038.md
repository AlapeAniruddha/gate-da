How many points of discontinuity does the curve $\displaystyle y=\frac{1}{u^{2} +u-2}$ have if $\displaystyle u=\frac{1}{x-1}$.

$3$

We have $\displaystyle x=1$ as a point of discontinuity given the way it is defined. Additionally:

$$
\begin{equation*}
\begin{aligned}
\frac{1}{u^{2} +u-2} & =\frac{1}{( u+2)( u-1)}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
$$

We see that $\displaystyle u=-2$ and $\displaystyle u=1$ are two additional points of discontinuity. These correspond to $\displaystyle x=\frac{1}{2}$ and $\displaystyle x=2$. Thus the curve has $\displaystyle 3$ points of discontinuity.
