Find the global minima of the function $f(x) =  2x^3 - 9x^2 + 12x + 6$ in the interval $(1, 3)$. You need to enter the value of $x^{*}$ and not the value of $f(x^{*})$.

We have $f^{\prime}(x) = 6x^2 - 18x + 12 = 6(x - 1)(x - 2)$ and $f^{\prime \prime}(x) = 6(2x - 3)$. The point $x = 1$ corresponds to a local maxima and $x = 2$ is a local minima. $f(1) = 11$ and $f(2) = 10$ and $f(3) = 15$. The function decreases from $x = 1$ to $x = 2$, attains a minima at $x = 2$ and then increases from $x = 2$ to $x = 3$. From this, we can conclude that $x = 2$ is the global minima of $f$ in the open interval $(1, 3)$.
