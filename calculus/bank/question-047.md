Consider $\displaystyle f:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ such that $\displaystyle f$ is an odd, differentiable function. $\displaystyle f$ has exactly one local maximum in the interval $\displaystyle ( 0,\infty )$ which occurs at some positive $\displaystyle x$. Which of the following statements are true if it is given that $\displaystyle f^{\prime }( 0) \neq 0$.

- [ ] $\displaystyle f$ has exactly one extremum
- [ ] $\displaystyle f$ has exactly two extrema
- [ ] $\displaystyle f$ has exactly one local minimum
- [ ] $\displaystyle f$ has exactly two local minima

- [x] $\displaystyle f$ has exactly two extrema
- [x] $\displaystyle f$ has exactly one local minimum

Since $\displaystyle f$ is odd, $\displaystyle f( -x) =-f( x)$. If $\displaystyle x_{0}$ corresponds to the local maximum in $\displaystyle [ 0,\infty )$, then $\displaystyle -x_{0}$ has to be a local minimum. Since $\displaystyle f^{\prime }( 0) \neq 0$, that cannot correspond to a point of extremum. Since $\displaystyle f$ is differentiable, we needn't worry about any other points. Therefore, $\displaystyle f$ has exactly two extrema, one is a local maximum and the other is a local minimum.
