The derivative at a point is the slope of the tangent at that point.

Let $\displaystyle f( x) =\frac{\pi \sin x}{x}$. The slopes of the tangents to the curve at the two given points are $\displaystyle f^{\prime }( \pi )$ and $\displaystyle f^{\prime }( -\pi )$.

$$
\begin{equation*}
\begin{aligned}
f^{\prime }( x) & =\pi \left[\frac{x\cos x-\sin x}{x^{2}}\right]
\end{aligned} \Longrightarrow \begin{aligned}
f^{\prime }( \pi ) & =-1\\
f^{\prime }( -\pi ) & =1
\end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
$$

Since the slopes satisfy $\displaystyle f^{\prime }( \pi ) \cdot f^{\prime}( -\pi ) =-1$, the two tangents are perpendicular to each other. Hence the angle between them is $\displaystyle \boxed{90^{\circ }}$.
