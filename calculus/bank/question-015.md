Consider the function:

$$
\begin{equation*}
f( x) =\begin{cases}
\sin( 2x) , & x\leqslant 0\\
mx, & x >0
\end{cases}
\end{equation*}
$$

- [ ] $\displaystyle f$ is continuous for exactly one value of $\displaystyle m$
- [ ] $\displaystyle f$ is continuous for any $\displaystyle m$
- [ ] $\displaystyle f$ is differentiable for exactly one value of $\displaystyle m$
- [ ] $\displaystyle f$ is differentiable for any $\displaystyle m$

- [ ] $\displaystyle f$ is continuous for exactly one value of $\displaystyle m$
- [x] $\displaystyle f$ is continuous for any $\displaystyle m$
- [x] $\displaystyle f$ is differentiable for exactly one value of $\displaystyle m$
- [ ] $\displaystyle f$ is differentiable for any $\displaystyle m$

We have:

$$
\begin{equation*}
\lim\limits _{x\rightarrow 0^{+}} \ f( x) =\lim\limits _{x\rightarrow 0^{-}} \ f( x) =0
\end{equation*}
$$

Since limit at $\displaystyle x=0$ is equal to $\displaystyle f( 0)$, $\displaystyle f$ is continuous for all $\displaystyle m$. The right hand derivative for $\displaystyle f$ at $\displaystyle x=0$ is $\displaystyle m$ and the left hand derivative at $\displaystyle x=0$ is $\displaystyle 2$. For $\displaystyle f$ to be differentiable at $\displaystyle x=0$, $\displaystyle m=2$ is the only possibility.
