Consider a function $\displaystyle f:[ -2,4]\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ defined as $\displaystyle f( x) =x^{3} +3x$. If the global maximum value of the function is $\displaystyle a$ and the global minimum value of the function is $\displaystyle b$, find $\displaystyle a+b$.

Does the function have any critical points?

$62$

We see that $\displaystyle f^{\prime }( x) =3x^{2} +3$. This is non-zero in the interval $\displaystyle [ -2,4]$. The function doesn't have any critical points in this interval. In fact, the function is strictly increasing in the interval. Therefore, the minimum has to occur at $\displaystyle x=-2$ and the maximum has to occur at $\displaystyle x=4$. The required result is.
$$
f( -2) +f( 4) =-14+76=\boxed{62}
