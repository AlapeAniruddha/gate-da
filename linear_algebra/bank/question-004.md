$S$ is a linearly independent subset of $\mathbb{R}^{4}$, select all true statements concerning $S$.

- [ ] $|S| \leqslant 4$ 

- [ ] Any subset of $S$ is also a linearly independent subset of $\mathbb{R}^{4}$.

- [ ] Any superset of $S$ is also a linearly independent subset of $\mathbb{R}^{4}$.

- [ ] $S$ is a basis for $\mathbb{R}^{4}$.
