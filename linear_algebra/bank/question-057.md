Let $\displaystyle S_{1}$ and $\displaystyle S_{2}$ be two subspaces of $\displaystyle \mathbb{R}^{10}$ with dimensions $\displaystyle 7$ and $\displaystyle 3$ respectively. Let $\displaystyle d$ be the dimension of $\displaystyle S_{1} \cap S_{2}$.

- [ ] The maximum possible value of $\displaystyle d$ is $\displaystyle 7$.
- [ ] The maximum possible value of $\displaystyle d$ is $\displaystyle 3$.
- [ ] The minimum possible value of $\displaystyle d$ is $\displaystyle 1$
- [ ] The minimum possible value of $\displaystyle d$ is $\displaystyle 0$.

- [ ] The maximum possible value of $\displaystyle d$ is $\displaystyle 7$.
- [x] The maximum possible value of $\displaystyle d$ is $\displaystyle 3$.
- [ ] The minimum possible value of $\displaystyle d$ is $\displaystyle 1$
- [x] The minimum possible value of $\displaystyle d$ is $\displaystyle 0$.

- Since the sum of the dimensions of the two subspaces is equal to the dimension of the parent subspace, it is possible for the two subspaces to have a trivial intersection. This suggests that the minimum possible value of $\displaystyle d$ is $\displaystyle 0$.

- If the smaller subspace is contained in the bigger subspace, that would give us the maximum possible value for $\displaystyle d$, which is $\displaystyle 3$.
