## Definition

A subset $\displaystyle U$ of a vector space $\displaystyle V$ is called a subspace if it is a vector space with the same additive identity, addition and scalar multiplication as $\displaystyle V$. To determine if a subset is a subspace, it is sufficient to check the following:

- $\displaystyle 0\in U$
- $\displaystyle U$ is closed under vector addition

- $\displaystyle U$ is closed under scalar multiplication

## Examples

- $\displaystyle \mathbb{R}^{2}$
    - Trivial subspaces
      - $\displaystyle \{( 0,0)\}$
      - $\displaystyle \mathbb{R}^{2}$

    - Non-trivial subspaces
      - Any line passing through the origin

    - These are the only subspace of $\displaystyle \mathbb{R}^{2}$

- $\displaystyle \mathbb{R}^{3}$
  - Trivial subspaces
    - $\displaystyle \{( 0,0,0)\}$
    - $\displaystyle \mathbb{R}^{3}$

  - Non-trivial subspaces
    - Any line passing through the origin
    - Any plane passing through the origin

  - These are the only subspaces of $\displaystyle \mathbb{R}^{3}$


## Properties

- If $\displaystyle U$ and $\displaystyle W$ are subspaces of $\displaystyle V$, $\displaystyle U\cap W$ is a subspace of $\displaystyle V$
- If $\displaystyle U$ and $\displaystyle W$ are subspaces of $\displaystyle V$, $\displaystyle U\cup W$ needn't be a subspace of $\displaystyle V$
  - Consider the x-axis and y-axis
  - The union is not closed under addition
