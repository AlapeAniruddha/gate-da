$X$ is the data/design matrix of shape $n \times d$, where $n$ is the number of data-points and $d$ is the number of features. The mean of the data-points is zero. Which of the following is the expression for the covariance matrix of the dataset?

- [ ] $\cfrac{XX^T}{n}$

  

- [ ] $\cfrac{XX^T}{d}$

  

- [ ] $\cfrac{X^TX}{n}$

  

- [ ] $\cfrac{X^TX}{d}$
