PCA is performed on a mean-centered dataset in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$. If the first principal component is $\cfrac{1}{\sqrt{6}}(1, -1, 2)$, which of the following could be the second principal component?

- [ ] $(0, 0, 0)$

  

- [ ] $\cfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(-1, -1, 0)$

  

- [ ] $(0, 1, 2)$

  

- [ ] $\cfrac{1}{\sqrt{5}}(0, 1, 2)$

- [ ] $(0, 0, 0)$

  

- [x] $\cfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(-1, -1, 0)$

  

- [ ] $(0, 1, 2)$

  

- [ ] $\cfrac{1}{\sqrt{5}}(0, 1, 2)$

The principal components are orthogonal eigenvectors of the covariance matrix. Since they are eigenvectors, $(0, 0, 0)$ is ruled out. Since they have to be orthogonal, only the second option is correct.
