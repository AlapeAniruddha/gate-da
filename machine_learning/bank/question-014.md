You have the following $5$ data points: $(0, 0), (2, 2), (4, 4), (5, 5)$ and $(10, 10)$, with corresponding labels $A, A, B, B$ and $A$. If you use KNN with $k = 3$, what will be the predicted label for a test point at $(3,3)$

- [ ] A

- [ ] B

- [ ] Cannot be determined

- [ ] A and B equally

All the five points lie on the line $y = x$. The distance computation therefore becomes quite trivial.
