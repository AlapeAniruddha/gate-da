Assume we have trained a linear regression model on a dataset with two features: 

- weight (in kilograms) 
- height (in meters). 

The model learned the parameters $w_0$, $w_1$ , and $w_2$, where $w_0$ is the bias, $w_1$ corresponds to weight (in kilograms), and $w_2$ corresponds to height (in meters). Now, if we change the unit of weight to grams and retrain the model on the same dataset, how will the learned weight parameters $w_1$ and $w_2$ change?

- [ ] $w_1$ will increase by a factor of 1000, $w_2$ will remain the same.

- [ ] $w_1$ will decrease by a factor of 1000, $w_2$ will remain the same.

- [ ] Both $w_1$ and $w_2$ will increase by a factor of 1000.

- [ ] Both $w_1$ and $w_2$ will remain unchanged.

- [ ] $w_1$ will increase by a factor of 1000, $w_2$ will remain the same.

- [x] $w_1$ will decrease by a factor of 1000, $w_2$ will remain the same.

- [ ] Both $w_1$ and $w_2$ will increase by a factor of 1000.

- [ ] Both $w_1$ and $w_2$ will remain unchanged.
