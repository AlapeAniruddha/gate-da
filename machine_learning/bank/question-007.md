Which of the following are directions associated with the principal components (PCs) that result from performing PCA?

- [ ] $\displaystyle ( 2)$ corresponds to the first PC and $\displaystyle ( 4)$ corresponds to the second PC
- [ ] $\displaystyle ( 4)$ corresponds to the first PC and $\displaystyle ( 2)$ corresponds to the second PC 
- [ ] $\displaystyle ( 3)$ corresponds to the first PC and $\displaystyle ( 1)$ corresponds to the second PC
- [ ] $\displaystyle ( 1)$ corresponds to the first PC and $\displaystyle ( 3)$ corresponds to the second PC

- [x] $\displaystyle ( 2)$ corresponds to the first PC and $\displaystyle ( 4)$ corresponds to the second PC
- [ ] $\displaystyle ( 4)$ corresponds to the first PC and $\displaystyle ( 2)$ corresponds to the second PC 
- [ ] $\displaystyle ( 3)$ corresponds to the first PC and $\displaystyle ( 1)$ corresponds to the second PC
- [ ] $\displaystyle ( 1)$ corresponds to the first PC and $\displaystyle ( 3)$ corresponds to the second PC

The direction of maximum variance is $\displaystyle ( 2)$. This is the first PC. $\displaystyle ( 4)$ is orthogonal to it and is the second PC.
