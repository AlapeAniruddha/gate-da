For a clustering problem with $n$ data-points and $k$ clusters, what is the maximum number of cluster assignments possible?

- [ ] $k^n$

- [ ] $n^k$

- [ ] $nk$

- [ ] $n + k$

- [x] $k^n$

- [ ] $n^k$

- [ ] $nk$

- [ ] $n + k$

Each data-point can belong to one of the $k$ clusters. Therefore, we have:

$$
k \times \cdots \times k = k^{n}
$$
